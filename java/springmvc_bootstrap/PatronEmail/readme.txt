This project demonstrates the use of Spring MVC with JSP JSTL and Bootstrap to build a web application.
For quick prototyping Jetty Maven plugin is also included.

Usage:
mvn clean package jetty:run

After Jetty starts open the following with your browser:
http://localhost:8080

You can log in with joe/bobcat.
When searching try searching for Arnold Andrews, or id 1,2,3.
You can find all the records in the PatronDirectory class.

Depending on your system you can stop Jetty with either Ctrl+C or killing the java process that is running it.
